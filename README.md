We all miss class sometimes. But what we don't realize is how much it adds up.

Zot Alarm combines your class attendence with accurate tuition data to show users the amount of money they are saving by attending class.
Utalizing the PeterPortal API, we collect information about class schedules and student courses, such as course timings, professor, and class dates. Using this course data, we connect to the GoogleMaps API to get coordinates of the user's lecture hall/classroom buildings and the user's current location to check if the user is going to class. If the user is supposed to be in class and they are not in the class location, Zot Alarm alerts the user and simultaneously shows the amount of tuition they are wasting by not attending class. The app keeps track of this financial data for the entire year, allowing the user to view a summary of the total tuition they have "wasted" by skipping class.

Zot Alarm also displays the information of who is currently skipping a class, allowing multiple users to interact with each other and giving them the opportunity to connect with one another and (hopefully) improve their habits. 


Zot Alarm is the guarenteed best way to increase attendence rate at UCI!
